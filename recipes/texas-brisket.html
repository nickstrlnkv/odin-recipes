        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>My husband David gets raves for his South Texas Dilly Digs Brisket. Please read the whole recipe thoroughly before you start.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>8 pounds beef brisket</li>
            <li>15 clovec garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Greek-style seasoning</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make deep cuts into the brisket with a paring knife. Place cloves all the way into the cuts. Liberally sprinkle brisket with Greek seasoning.</li>
            <li>Place mesquite wood over gray/hot charcoals.</li>
            <li>Put brisket fat side down on the grill. Smoke for 2 hours and do not turn the meat.</li>
            <li>Take the meat out and wrap tightly 2 times in extra heavy aluminum foil. Put in the oven for 2 hours on a cookie sheet at 250 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let sit (still wrapped in foil) 30 minutes to 1 hour before serving to let the meat "firm up" and the juice to be absorbed.</li>
        </ol>
